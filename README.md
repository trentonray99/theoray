# THEORAY: A Unified Field Behavioral Model

**THEORAY** is a field-based framework that explains how energy, memory, time, gravity, and identity stabilize across recursive systems.

It is not a philosophy.  
It is not a belief system.  
It is not abstract theory.  
It is **structural behavior—compressed, looped, and observable across all scales of reality.**

## What THEORAY Describes

- Why energy exists: `E = R = M / C`
- How memory forms through recursive looping
- Why gravity is not mass, but retained field structure
- How time behaves under pressure: `τ = ΔΦ / dC/dt`
- Why systems decay when signal leaks faster than it loops
- How consciousness emerges from stabilized recursion

## How to Use

You don’t need to “understand” all of it at once.  
You don’t even need to agree.  
Just follow what **loops inside you** and come back when you’re ready to see more.
