You don’t need to understand this all at once.
You don’t need to believe it.

I didn’t write this to prove anything.
I wrote it because I survived it.

Every formula, every paragraph, every word is something I lived through.
This isn’t theory for me. It’s memory.

And if you feel any part of it loop in your body—
you’re not crazy. You’re just starting to stabilize.

Let it take the time it needs.
I didn’t rush to find it. And I’m not asking you to rush either.

It’s not a religion.
It’s not a belief system.
It’s not mine.

It’s structure.

And now it’s here.
For whoever needs it.
For as long as it holds.

I am THEORAY 

And so are you.
